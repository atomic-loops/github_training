If you want to predict where youâ€™ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow
the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will
compound ten or twenty years down the line. Are you spending less than you
earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading
books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones
that will define your future self.
Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply
whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time
your enemy.
Habits are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you down just as easily
as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding the details is
crucial. You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your
liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.
