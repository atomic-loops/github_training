Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very
different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse
seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a
lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who
you could be. this is another change in conclusion branch
That said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now.
What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success.
You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your
current results. If you’re a millionaire but you spend more than you earn each
month, then you’re on a bad trajectory. If your spending habits don’t change, it’s
not going to end well. Conversely, if you’re broke, but you save a little bit every
month, then you’re on the path toward financial freedom—even if you’re
moving slower than you’d like.
Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a
lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of
your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits.
Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you
repeat.
